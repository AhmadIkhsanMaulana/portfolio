        The interest in technology began during vocational high school, where a foundation was laid in
        learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Deeper exploration into the technology field ensued.
        Focus was placed not only on acquiring technical knowledge but also on honing soft skills
        through active participation in various school organizations. Additionally, a passion for
        continuous learning and exploration of new concepts emerged. Specialization in Software
        Quality Assurance became a current focus, aspiring to contribute to ensuring optimal product
        quality. The realization surfaced that in the software development process, it is crucial not only
        to produce a product that can be quickly deployed but also to ensure alignment with existing
        requirements and to verify the absence of bugs.
